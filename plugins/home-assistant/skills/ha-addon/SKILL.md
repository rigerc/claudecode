# Home Assistant Add-on Development

## Quick Start

Create and manage Home Assistant add-ons:

```
"Create a new Home Assistant add-on for Node-RED"
"Build and test this add-on locally"
"Fix Docker build issues in my add-on"
"Set up CI/CD for add-on publishing"
```

## How It Works

1. **Add-on Creation** - Initial structure, configuration files, Dockerfiles
2. **Building & Testing** - Docker builds, local testing, container debugging
3. **Configuration** - YAML files, build settings, security profiles
4. **Integration** - Home Assistant APIs, ingress, authentication
5. **Publishing** - Repository setup, versioning, distribution

## Expertise Areas

- Docker containerization and multi-architecture builds
- YAML configuration and build automation
- Security (AppArmor, permissions, API access)
- Home Assistant ecosystem integration
