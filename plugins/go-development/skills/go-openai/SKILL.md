# Go OpenAI Integration

## Quick Start

Integrate OpenAI APIs into Go applications:

```
"Set up OpenAI client for chat completions"
"Implement function calling with GPT-4"
"Add image generation with DALL-E"
"Create embeddings for semantic search"
```

## How It Works

1. **Client Setup** - Authentication, configuration, API keys
2. **Core Features** - Chat, completions, embeddings, images
3. **Advanced Integration** - Function calling, streaming, async
4. **Production Ready** - Error handling, retries, rate limiting

## Supported Features

- **GPT Models** - Chat completions, text generation
- **DALL-E** - Image generation and editing
- **Whisper** - Audio transcription and translation
- **Embeddings** - Vector embeddings for search
- **Fine-tuning** - Custom model training
