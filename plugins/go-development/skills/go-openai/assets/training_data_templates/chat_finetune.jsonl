It uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources, which are identified by URLs. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request contains all information needed to complete the request."}]}

They excel at handling structured data and maintaining consistency (ACID properties). Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL. NoSQL databases are non-relational and can handle unstructured data with flexible schemas. They're better for horizontal scaling and handling large volumes of varied data. Examples include MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (wide-column)."}]}

Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient. Docker is the most popular containerization platform. Containers provide consistency across development, testing, and production environments, solve dependency issues, and enable microservices architecture."}]}

It works by creating snapshots of your project at different points in time (commits). Each commit has a unique hash and references to parent commits, forming a directed acyclic graph. Git allows branching for parallel development, merging changes, and collaboration. Key concepts include repositories, commits, branches, merges, and remotes."}]}

It provides on-demand access to computing resources like servers, storage, databases, networking, and software. The main service models are IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service). Benefits include scalability, cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and reduced maintenance overhead."}]}
