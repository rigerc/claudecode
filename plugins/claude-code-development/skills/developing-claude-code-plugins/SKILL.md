# Developing Claude Code Plugins

## Quick Start

Work with Claude Code plugins effectively:

```
"Create a new plugin for GitHub integration"
"Fix my plugin that's not loading properly"
"Set up testing for my Claude Code plugin"
"Release this plugin to the marketplace"
```

## How It Works

1. **Plugin Creation** - Initial structure, configuration, manifest setup
2. **Development** - Skills, commands, hooks, agents implementation
3. **Testing & Debugging** - Local testing, validation, error handling
4. **Release Management** - Versioning, marketplace publishing

## Plugin Components

- **Skills** - Specialized capabilities and workflows
- **Commands** - Slash commands and CLI integration
- **Hooks** - Event-driven automation
- **Agents** - Specialized AI sub-agents
