# Beets Music Library Management

## Quick Start

Manage and organize your music library with beets:

```
"Set up beets for my music library"
"Import and organize 1000+ music files"
"Create custom plugins for beets"
"Fix metadata inconsistencies in my library"
```

## How It Works

1. **Library Setup** - Initial configuration, database, import rules
2. **Import & Organization** - Automatic tagging, folder structure, naming
3. **Metadata Management** - Querying, editing, consistency checks
4. **Plugin Development** - Custom functionality, automation
5. **Advanced Workflows** - Querying, reporting, library maintenance

## Core Capabilities

- **Smart Importing** - Automatic metadata lookup and tagging
- **Flexible Queries** - Powerful search and filtering
- **Plugin System** - Extensible architecture
- **Automation** - Custom workflows and scripts

See [detailed guide](references/detailed-guide.md) for complete configuration and plugin development.
