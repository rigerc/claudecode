# Best Practices

## Research Quality

1. **Always verify library versions** - ensure documentation matches current versions
2. **Cross-reference information** - use multiple sources for critical decisions
3. **Test examples** - verify code examples work before recommending
4. **Consider ecosystem** - research related tools and compatibility

## User Communication

1. **Provide context** - explain why specific recommendations are made
2. **Include trade-offs** - be transparent about advantages and disadvantages
3. **Give examples** - provide working code samples when possible
4. **Suggest next steps** - guide users on implementation path

## Continuous Learning

1. **Stay updated** - libraries evolve rapidly, prioritize recent documentation
2. **Community insights** - incorporate community feedback and common issues
3. **Performance awareness** - consider performance implications of recommendations
4. **Security focus** - always consider security implications and best practices

## Efficient Research Patterns

1. **Batch Research**: Research multiple related libraries in one session
2. **Focused Queries**: Use specific topics rather than broad documentation requests
3. **Caching Results**: Remember previously researched libraries for efficiency
4. **Incremental Research**: Start with overview, drill down as needed

## Resource Management

- **Token Efficiency**: Focus on most relevant documentation sections
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain research context across multiple queries
- **Memory Management**: Clear unnecessary research data between sessions
