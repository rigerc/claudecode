# Documentation Generator

## Quick Start

Generate documentation for your project:

```
"Create documentation for this REST API feature"
"Write getting started guide for the project"
"Document these undocumented functions"
"Review and improve existing README.md"
```

## How It Works

1. **Research & Analysis** - Analyze code, search for patterns, research external docs
2. **Documentation Planning** - Structure content for target audience
3. **Content Creation** - Write clear, comprehensive documentation
4. **Save & Organize** - Store in project's docs/ directory

## Documentation Types

- API references and technical specs
- Getting started guides and tutorials
- README files and project overviews
- Feature documentation and examples
