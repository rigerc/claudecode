## 📋 Task Management System

**Every action = One documented task in kanban.md**

## 📚 Complete Documentation

**⚠️ READ IMMEDIATELY**: `AI_WORKFLOW.md`

This file contains everything: format, workflow, commands, examples.

## ⚙️ Critical Rule #1

**NO `##` or `###` headings inside a task**
- Use `**Subtasks**:` and `**Notes**:` with colons
- Subsections: `**Result**:`, `**Modified files**:`

**Why?** The HTML parser does not recognize `##` inside tasks.
