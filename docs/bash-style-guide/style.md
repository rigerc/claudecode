# Style

This section outlines style guidelines that directly impact the functionality of Bash scripts. It includes best practices for quoting and variable declaration.

## Using Quotes

In Bash, the type of quotes you use—single, double, or none—affects how strings and variables are interpreted. Understanding when to use each type is crucial to avoid common pitfalls, such as unintended [word splitting](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting), [globbing](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob), and [parameter expansion](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Parameters#Parameter_Expansion).

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info
//// tab | Double Quotes (`"`)

- **First Choice**: Use double quotes as the default method of quoting strings and variables.
    - **Reason**: Double quotes allow the shell to interpret [expansions](https://guide.bash.academy/expansions/) (such as variables, command substitutions, and escape sequences) while preventing word splitting and globbing.

///// admonition | Example
    type: example

```bash
name="John Doe"
echo "Hello, $name"
```

/////
////
//// tab | Single Quotes (`'`)

- **String Literals**: Use single quotes to define string literals.
    - **Reason**: Single quotes preserve the literal value of every character in a string, preventing the shell from performing expansions or substitutions. This behavior is essential for commands like `find`, `grep`, and `awk`, which have their own rules for interpreting special characters. Using single quotes ensures that these commands receive the input exactly as written, without modification by the shell.

///// admonition | Example
    type: example

_Literal string_:

```bash
echo '${C_BLUE}This is a literal ${string} with no variable substitution${C_NC}'
```

---

_Command argument_:

```bash
find . -name '*.txt' -exec grep 'pattern.*here' {} \; -print
```

/////
////
//// tab | Omitting Quotes

- **When to Omit Quotes**: In certain cases, quotes can be safely omitted without risk. Common scenarios include arithmetic operations and double bracket tests.
    - **Arithmetic Operations (`$(( ... ))`)**: [Arithmetic expansion](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/ArithmeticExpression) treats the content as a single unit, preventing word splitting and globbing.
    - **Double Bracket Tests `[[ ... ]]`**: The `[[ ... ]]` syntax is a Bash built-in that protects against word splitting and globbing, allowing comparisons and checks without the need for quotes.

///// admonition | Example
    type: example

```bash
# Arithmetic operation.
sum=$((5 + 3))

## Double brackets to perform a comparison test.
if [[ $variable == "value" ]]; then
    echo "Matched"
fi
```

/////
////
//// tab | Recommendations

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enable syntax highlighting in your IDE or text editor.
    - **Reason**: Syntax highlighting visually distinguishes different code elements, such as keywords, strings, and variables, making it easier to identify potential issues, such as missing quotes, misplaced escape sequences, or incorrect special characters. This feature enhances debugging by making errors more visible and improving overall code readability.
- **When in Doubt, Quote**: If unsure whether quotes are necessary, it's recommended to use them. Quoting variables and strings by default helps prevent common pitfalls.

## Declaring and Naming Variables

Bash offers several methods for declaring variables, each with implications for scope, immutability, and readability. Following best practices for naming and declaring variables is essential to maintain consistency and avoid unintended side effects

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info
//// tab | Global and Local Variables

- **Naming Convention**: Use `snake_case` for variable names.
- **Scope Management**: Use the `local` keyword to limit a variable's scope to within a function.
    - **Reason**: Declaring a variable as `local` prevents accidental overwrites of global variables with the same name. It also ensures that once the function completes, the variable is unset and released from memory. (1)
        { .annotate }

        1. **Variable Scope**: In Bash, variables declared inside a function without the `local` keyword are global by default, meaning they persist beyond the function's scope and can impact other parts of the script.

    - **Example**:
        ```bash
        my_var="global value"

        my_function() {
            # This local variable won't overwrite the global variable.
            local my_var="local value"
            echo "$my_var"
        }

        my_function
        echo "$my_var"
        ```
        **Explanation**: In this example, `my_var` is defined both globally and locally within `my_function`. The `local` keyword ensures that the `my_var` inside the function is distinct from the global `my_var`. When the function is called, it outputs the local value, whereas the final `echo` statement outputs the global value.

////
//// tab | Constant Variables

- **Naming Conventions**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` with a `C_` prefix for constants (e.g., `C_CONFIG_FILE_PATH`).
    - **Reason**: This naming convention helps distinguish constants from other variables and aligns with common practices across various programming languages. (1)
        { .annotate }

        1. **Constants and Environment Variables**: Constants typically use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, a standard followed in many languages, such as C, Python, and Java. Adopting a common convention ensures that other developers can easily recognize constants in your scripts. However, in Unix-like systems, environment variables are also written in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. To prevent confusion, a prefix such as `C_` is used to differentiate constants from environment variables.

    - **Alternative Prefix**: While `C_` is the default prefix for constants, other prefixes like `CONST_` or `CONFIG_` may be used if they better suit your naming conventions or project requirements. The key is to maintain consistency within your script or project.
        - **Example**: The [oh-my-zsh project](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) uses the `OMZ_` prefix to clearly indicate constants as part of the project while following the `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` convention.

- **Selective Use of `readonly`**: Use `readonly` to define constants that must remain unchanged throughout the script.
    - **Reason**: The `readonly` keyword enforces immutability, preventing accidental modification of critical values. However, overusing `readonly` can make scripts overly restrictive and complicate development and debugging. Therefore, reserve `readonly` for values that are _truly_ immutable.
    - **Declaration**: Use `readonly` when initializing the variable or immediately afterward.
    - **Example of When to Use**:
        - **Global Constants**: Apply `readonly` to global constants where changes could significantly affect script behavior or cause unexpected results.
    - **Example of When to Omit**:
        - **Function-Dependent Initialization**: Avoid using `readonly` when a constant's value is determined by a function or a complex operation.
            - **Reason**: Applying `readonly` to a variable initialized by a function can cause errors if the function is called multiple times. To avoid reinitialization errors, omit `readonly` unless safeguards are in place to prevent reassignment.

///// details | Example
    type: example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

## Constant variables using the naming convention with 'C_' prefix.
readonly C_CONFIG_FILE_PATH="/etc/myapp/config.conf"
readonly C_MAX_RETRIES=5
readonly C_API_ENDPOINT="https://api.example.com/data"

## Function that determines a value based on conditions.
initialize_dynamic_constant() {
    local environment="$1"

    if [[ "$environment" == "production" ]]; then
        C_DYNAMIC_URL="https://prod.example.com/api"
    else
        C_DYNAMIC_URL="https://dev.example.com/api"
    fi
}

# Call the function to initialize the dynamic constant.
initialize_dynamic_constant "production"

# Use the initialized values (note that C_DYNAMIC_URL is not readonly).
echo "API Endpoint: $C_API_ENDPOINT"
echo "Max Retries: $C_MAX_RETRIES"
echo "Configuration File Path: $C_CONFIG_FILE_PATH"
echo "Dynamic URL: $C_DYNAMIC_URL"

# Attempting to modify a readonly variable will result in an error.
# Uncommenting the line below will cause the script to fail.
#C_API_ENDPOINT="https://newapi.example.com"

## Function to perform an operation based on the constants.
perform_operation() {
    for ((i = 1; i <= C_MAX_RETRIES; i++)); do
        echo "Attempt $i: Fetching data from $C_API_ENDPOINT"
        sleep 1  # Simulate API call.
        break  # Break after first attempt for demo purposes.
    done
}

# Perform the operation using the constants.
perform_operation
```

////
//// tab | Exported Variables

<!-- TODO: Come back and update wording for 'Reason' and annotation. -->

- **Naming Conventions**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` with an `E_` prefix for exported variables (e.g., `E_PATH`).
    - **Reason**: This naming convention differentiates exported variables from other variable types and aligns with the Unix naming convention for environment variables. (1)
        { .annotate }

        1. **Exported and Environment Variables**: Under Unix conventions, environment variables are written in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. However, just like constants, using the same naming convention for exported variables can cause confusion and lead to accidental modifications of existing environment variables. A prefix such as `E_` is used to differentiate exported variables from others while adhering to the `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` convention.

- **Declaration**: Use `export` when initializing an exported variable or immediately afterward.

///// details | Example
    type: example

```bash
# Overwrites the existing $PATH environment variable.
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/"

## Does NOT overwrite the existing $PATH environment variable.
E_PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/"
export E_PATH
```

/////
////
//// tab | Using `declare`

<!-- TODO: Re-review the wording of the below guidelines. -->

- **Selective Use**: Use the `declare` command to manage advanced variable attributes, such as associative arrays. For simple variable declarations, or when keywords like `local` and `readonly` are sufficient, avoid using `declare`.
    - **Reason**: The `declare` command is useful for managing complex variable types, such as associative arrays, or when specific attributes are needed. However, using `declare` for basic variable assignments can reduce readability and is often unnecessary.

///// details | Example
    type: example

```bash
# Associative array containing the configuration settings for sshd_config.
declare -A C_SSHD_CONFIG=(
    ["LogLevel"]="VERBOSE"
    ["LoginGraceTime"]="30"
    ["PermitRootLogin"]="no"
    ["MaxAuthTries"]="3"
    ["MaxSessions"]="2"
    ["PubkeyAuthentication"]="yes"
    ["PermitEmptyPasswords"]="no"
    ["ChallengeResponseAuthentication"]="no"
    ["KbdInteractiveAuthentication"]="no"
    ["UsePAM"]="yes"
    ["AllowAgentForwarding"]="no"
    ["AllowTcpForwarding"]="no"
    ["X11Forwarding"]="no"
    ["PrintMotd"]="no"
    ["TCPKeepAlive"]="no"
    ["Compression"]="no"
    ["ClientAliveInterval"]="300"
    ["ClientAliveCountMax"]="2"
)
readonly C_SSHD_CONFIG
```

<!-- ## Shebang in Bash Scripts

The shebang (`#!`) in Bash scripts is a crucial component that specifies the interpreter to execute the script. The choice of shebang can significantly affect a script's compatibility and behavior across different operating systems and environments. Understanding the purpose and appropriate usage of different shebangs is essential for writing robust Bash scripts.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Universal Compatibility**: Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for scripts that need to run on various operating systems, including BSD, macOS, Linux, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
    - **Reason**: This shebang leverages the `env` command to search the user's `PATH` for the first instance of the Bash executable, ensuring the script can locate Bash regardless of its installation location.
- **Linux-Specific Scripts**: Use `#!/bin/bash` for scripts intended to run exclusively on Linux.
    - **Reason**: On Linux systems, Bash is typically located at `/bin/bash`. This shebang is suitable for scripts designed exclusively for Linux, where cross-platform compatibility is not necessary.
- **Non-Standard Installations**: For environments with non-standard Bash installations, specify the exact path to the Bash interpreter in the shebang to ensure correct execution.
    - **Example**:
        ```bash
        #!/usr/local/bin/bash
        echo "This script is designed for environments where Bash is installed in a non-standard location."
        ```
///

/// admonition | Why the Choice Matters
    type: tip

- **Executable Location**: On systems like BSD and macOS, Bash may be installed in a different location than on Linux. Sometimes, the default Bash version is outdated, prompting users to install an alternative version. For example, many macOS users upgrade Bash via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which installs it at `/usr/local/bin/bash` on Intel Macs or `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` on Apple Silicon, while the system version remains at `/bin/bash`.
- **Script Portability**: The shebang choice affects whether your script can be executed on different systems without modification. Using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` enhances portability by ensuring the script can locate the Bash interpreter regardless of its installation path.
- **System Compliance and Security**: In environments where system integrity and security are critical, using a direct path like `#!/bin/bash` ensures the script runs with the system’s default, vetted Bash interpreter, reducing the risk of unintended behavior from using an alternative version.
