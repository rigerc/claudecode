# Design Thinking: Pre-Coding Workflow

## Overview

Before writing code or generating design, establish the intentional foundation. This workflow prevents default thinking and ensures your design serves a purpose beyond aesthetic choice.

## The Pre-Design Checklist

Don't design until you answer these four questions:

1. **Purpose**: What problem are we solving? Who are we solving it for?
2. **Tone**: What emotional response do we want? What aesthetic direction reflects this?
3. **Constraints**: What are the real technical, temporal, or business limits?
4. **Differentiation**: What one unforgettable element makes this distinctly ours?

---

## 1. Purpose: Problem & Users

### Understand the Problem

Before choosing any visual element, define what you're solving:

**Questions to Answer**:
- What specific problem does this design solve?
- Who are the primary users? (age, technical skill, context)
- What emotions are they bringing to this interface? (frustrated, excited, skeptical)
- What's the desired outcome after interaction?
- What makes this problem unique vs. competitors?

### User Context Worksheet

```
Primary User:
- Age & background: ___________
- Technical skill level: ___________
- Primary use context: (work, leisure, research, etc.)
- How much time will they spend here? ___________
- What's their emotional state on arrival? ___________

Problem They're Solving:
- Specific challenge: ___________
- Current workaround (how do they solve it now?): ___________
- Desired outcome: ___________
- What's the cost of not solving it? ___________

Success Metrics:
- How will we know if this design works? ___________
- What behavior change indicates success? ___________
```

### Example: Task Management App

```
Problem:
  - Users feel overwhelmed by task lists
  - They abandon systems because of overhead (too complex, too much friction)
  - They need fast input and clarity, not features

Users:
  - Busy professionals (35-55 years old)
  - Moderate technical skill
  - Using on mobile during context switches
  - Frustrated with complex tools, skeptical of new ones

Success Indicators:
  - They return daily (habit formation)
  - They create tasks in under 5 seconds
  - They feel less overwhelmed (self-reported)
```

## 2. Tone: Aesthetic Direction

### Define Emotional Intent

Based on your purpose, what emotional response should the design evoke?

**Emotional Directions**:
- **Trustworthy**: Professional, calm, reliable (finance, healthcare)
- **Energetic**: Playful, bold, surprising (creator tools, social)
- **Sophisticated**: Elegant, refined, literary (luxury, editorial)
- **Direct**: Minimal, fast, no-nonsense (productivity tools)
- **Warm**: Inviting, personable, human (community, education)
- **Bold**: Confident, unconventional, statement-making (startups, innovation)

### Tone Definition Worksheet

```
Emotional Intent:
- Primary emotion we want users to feel: ___________
- Tone adjectives (3-5): ___________
- What should users think when they see this? ___________
- What should they feel when they interact? ___________

Design Personality:
- Is this design "serious" or "playful"?
- Is it "minimal" or "expressive"?
- Is it "traditional" or "unconventional"?
- Is it "warm" or "cool"?

Visual Direction:
- Color personality: (warm, cool, saturated, muted)
- Typography style: (traditional, modern, handcrafted, geometric)
- Motion style: (snappy, smooth, playful, none)
- Overall style: (minimalist, maximalist, balanced)
```

### Example: Task Management App (Continued)

```
Emotional Intent:
  - Primary: Calm confidence (you can do this)
  - Adjectives: Clear, fast, human, encouraging, focused
  - Thought: "I can get things done here"
  - Feeling: Supported, not overwhelmed

Design Personality:
  - Serious ↔ Playful: 60% serious, 40% playful
  - Minimal ↔ Expressive: 70% minimal
  - Traditional ↔ Unconventional: 40% traditional, 60% unconventional
  - Warm ↔ Cool: 60% warm

Visual Direction:
  - Colors: Warm neutrals (creams, warm grays) + one warm accent (burnt orange)
  - Typography: Warm humanist sans (IBM Plex) + elegant serif for emphasis
  - Motion: Snappy, encouraging (quick feedback)
  - Overall: Minimalist with human warmth (not cold minimal)
```

## 3. Constraints: Reality Check

### Define Technical, Business, and Creative Limits

Before designing, know your boundaries:

**Categories**:
- **Technical**: Browser support, performance budget, framework limitations
- **Temporal**: How long do you have to build?
- **Business**: Brand guidelines, compliance requirements, market positioning
- **Creative**: Audience expectations, competitive landscape

### Constraints Worksheet

```
Technical Constraints:
- Required browser support: ___________
- Performance budget: (load time, interaction delay)
- Required frameworks/libraries: ___________
- API availability/limitations: ___________
- Device support (mobile first?): ___________

Temporal Constraints:
- Design timeline: ___________
- Development timeline: ___________
- Launch date: ___________
- Available resources: ___________

Business Constraints:
- Brand guidelines to follow: (yes/no, which parts?)
- Compliance requirements: (WCAG, GDPR, etc.)
- Target market expectations: ___________
- Pricing/positioning tier: (premium, budget, etc.)

Creative Freedom:
- How much can we deviate from industry norms?
- Are we required to use specific design patterns?
- Any visual or interaction taboos?
```

### Example: Task Management App (Continued)

```
Technical:
  - Mobile-first (iOS/Android)
  - Web (Chrome, Safari, Firefox last 2 years)
  - Progressive Web App (offline support)
  - Performance: <2s initial load, <100ms interactions

Temporal:
  - 8 weeks from start to launch
  - Design: weeks 1-3, Dev: weeks 2-7, Polish: weeks 7-8

Business:
  - Position as "simple alternative to Asana/Notion"
  - WCAG 2.1 AA required
  - No enterprise features (keep it simple)
  - Premium/paid product (not freemium)

Creative:
  - Can deviate from "default task app" look
  - No dark patterns, no urgency-driven design
  - Anti-pattern: Don't look like Notion, Asana, or Todoist
```

## 4. Differentiation: The Unforgettable Element

### Identify One Distinctive Feature

Every intentional design has one element that makes it memorable and distinctly yours. This isn't about complexity—it's about one deliberate choice that stands out.

### Differentiation Framework

**Types of Differentiation**:

1. **Typography Signature**
   - A distinctive typeface pairing
   - Unusual size or weight hierarchy
   - Custom font treatment
   - Example: "We pair serif headlines with monospace body text"

2. **Color Signature**
   - An unexpected color choice in an expected place
   - A color that exists nowhere else in the category
   - Color that tells a story
   - Example: "Burnt orange accent in a tool that's usually all blue"

3. **Motion Signature**
   - A particular animation pattern no one else uses
   - Orchestration that guides the eye
   - A interaction that feels unique
   - Example: "Staggered reveals that feel orchestrated, not random"

4. **Layout/Composition Signature**
   - An unusual spatial arrangement
   - Asymmetrical composition
   - Unexpected visual rhythm
   - Example: "Sidebar on the right instead of left"

5. **Micro-interaction Signature**
   - A delight that appears on interaction
   - Easter egg or surprise element
   - Unique feedback pattern
   - Example: "Icons that animate in unexpected ways on hover"

6. **Visual Detail Signature**
   - Illustration style
   - Pattern or texture
   - Specific visual treatment
   - Example: "Custom illustrations that appear throughout"

### Differentiation Worksheet

```
Current State (What do competitors do?):
- Typography: ___________
- Color: ___________
- Motion: ___________
- Layout: ___________
- Interactions: ___________

Our Differentiation (What will we do differently?):
- Chosen category: (Typography, Color, Motion, etc.)
- The specific distinctive choice: ___________
- Why this choice? (How does it serve the purpose & tone?)
- Where will it appear? (Headline, accent, hover state, etc.)
- Is it instantly recognizable as "ours"? (Yes/No)

The Unforgettable Element:
- In one sentence, describe what makes this design distinctly ours:
  ___________
```

### Example: Task Management App (Final)

```
Current State:
  - All task apps use blue/purple accents
  - All use sans-serif exclusively
  - Motion is minimal or absent
  - Layouts are all center-column with sidebar
  - Interactions are predictable

Our Differentiation:
  - Chosen category: Typography + Color + Motion
  - Typography: Warm serif headlines (Crimson Pro) paired with humanist sans (IBM Plex)
  - Color: Burnt orange accent instead of blue
  - Motion: Snappy, orchestrated task creation with staggered animations

The Unforgettable Element:
  "When you complete a task, it doesn't just disappear—it elegantly scrolls away
   with a warm celebration (subtle confetti-like dots) and the interface adjusts
   with satisfying motion that makes you feel like you accomplished something."
```

## Using This Foundation in Design Brief

Once you've completed the pre-design thinking, create a design brief:

```markdown
# Design Brief: [Project Name]

## Problem & Purpose
[Your answer from section 1]

## Target User
[User context from section 1]

## Emotional Intent & Tone
[Your tone definition from section 2]

## Visual Direction
- Typography approach: [Your answer]
- Color approach: [Your answer]
- Motion approach: [Your answer]

## Constraints
- Technical: [Your constraints]
- Timeline: [Your constraints]
- Business: [Your constraints]

## Differentiation Strategy
[Your unforgettable element]

## Success Metrics
[How we'll know this works]
```

## Anti-Pattern: Designing Without Foundation

**What NOT to do**:
```
"Let's make a task app. Use modern design. Blue accent color.
Put a card here, buttons there. Done."
```

**Why this fails**:
- No emotional intent (defaults to generic)
- No differentiation (looks like every other task app)
- No constraint awareness (might not work technically)
- No purpose beyond "make a thing"

**What TO do instead**:
```
"This app is for busy professionals who are skeptical of new tools.
We want them to feel calm confidence. We'll differentiate with
warm serif typography and burnt orange accents. Motion will be
snappy and encouraging. The unforgettable element is the delight
of task completion with orchestrated motion."
```

This brief is actionable. It guides design decisions, not defaults to them.

- [ ] Can you articulate the specific problem you're solving in one sentence?
- [ ] Can you describe the primary user in detail?
- [ ] Have you defined the emotional intent (not just "modern")?
- [ ] Can you name the tone adjectives that describe your design?
- [ ] Do you know your technical constraints?
- [ ] Do you know your timeline?
- [ ] Can you describe one unforgettable element that's distinctly yours?
- [ ] Would you describe your design direction as "intentional" or "defaulted"?

If you can't answer all of these, go back and refine your thinking.
