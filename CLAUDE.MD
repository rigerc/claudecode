**Note**: This project uses [bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)
for issue tracking. Use `bd` commands instead of markdown TODOs.
See AGENTS.md for workflow details.

**Important**: NEVER edit files in ~/.claude/ or /home/ without askkking for confirmation from the user.

**Skills Research Rule**: Always research relevant frameworks, libraries, and best practices before invoking the skill-creator skill to get context on the requested skill. Use the documentation-generation:library-researcher skill or MCP tools to understand the technical ecosystem, available APIs, and established patterns for the requested skill.
